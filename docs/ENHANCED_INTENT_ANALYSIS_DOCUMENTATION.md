## 🔍 **Intent Analysis Algorithm**

### **1. Keyword Detection**
```javascript
const analyzeFollowUpIntent = (message) => {
  const messageLower = message.toLowerCase();
  const intent = {
    type: 'general',
    preferences: {},
    keywords: []
  };

  // Business-related intent
  if (messageLower.includes('business') || messageLower.includes('fbla') || messageLower.includes('entrepreneur')) {
    intent.type = 'business';
    intent.preferences.category = 'Business';
    intent.preferences.interests = ['Business', 'Leadership', 'Entrepreneurship'];
    intent.keywords = ['business', 'fbla', 'entrepreneur'];
  }
  
  // STEM-focused intent
  else if (messageLower.includes('stem') || messageLower.includes('science') || messageLower.includes('technology')) {
    intent.type = 'stem';
    intent.preferences.category = 'STEM';
    intent.preferences.interests = ['STEM', 'Science', 'Technology', 'Engineering'];
    intent.keywords = ['stem', 'science', 'technology', 'engineering'];
  }
  
  // ... more intent types
};
```

### **2. Context Preservation**
```javascript
const conversationContext = {
  originalAnswers: {},           // Initial user answers
  followUpRequests: [],          // History of follow-up requests
  currentRecommendations: [],    // Latest recommendations
  recommendationHistory: [],     // All clubs ever recommended
  userPreferences: {}            // Evolving user preferences
};
```

### **3. Dynamic Recommendation Filtering**
```javascript
// Avoid repeating previous recommendations unless they perfectly match new criteria
const previousClubNames = [...new Set([
  ...previousRecommendations.map(r => r.clubName), 
  ...recommendationHistory
])];

clubs.forEach(club => {
  if (!previousClubNames.includes(club.name)) {
    // Only suggest clubs not previously recommended
  }
});
```

## 💻 **Component Usage**

### Basic Implementation
```jsx
import { allClubData } from '../data/clubData';
import AIClubChatbot from '../components/AIClubChatbot';

function ClubsPage() {
  return (
    <div>

      {/* Enhanced AI Chatbot with intent analysis */}
      <AIClubChatbot allClubData={allClubData} />
    </div>
  );
