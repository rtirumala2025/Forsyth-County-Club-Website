```jsx
<AIClubChatbot 
  allClubData={allClubData}    // Array of school data objects from clubData.js
/>
```

## üèóÔ∏è Expected Data Structure

The component expects the `allClubData` array from your `clubData.js` file:

```javascript
// From src/data/clubData.js
export const allClubData = [
  {
    school: 'East Forsyth High School',
    clubs: [
      {
        id: 'asl-club',
        name: 'American Sign Language Club',
        description: 'A student group that teaches and practices American Sign Language...',
        sponsor: 'Not listed on EFHS site...',
        category: 'Cultural',
        meetingFrequency: 'Weekly',
        meetingDay: 'Fridays at lunch...',
        requirements: 'Open to all students...',
        activities: ['Beginner & intermediate sign lessons', 'Deaf culture workshops', ...],
        commitment: 'Low‚ÄìMedium ‚Äî weekly practice plus occasional weekend outreach events',
        benefits: ['Basic ASL fluency', 'Cultural competency', ...]
      },
      // ... more clubs
    ]
  },
  {
    school: 'West Forsyth High School',
    clubs: [
      // ... clubs for West Forsyth
    ]
  }
  // ... more schools
];
```

## üéØ Enhanced Questions Flow

The chatbot now asks 7 comprehensive questions:

1. **School Selection**: "Which school do you attend?" (with clickable buttons)
2. **Interests**: "What are your main interests?"
3. **Time Commitment**: "How much time can you commit weekly?"
4. **Club Type**: "What kind of club experience are you looking for?"
5. **Skills/Goals**: "What skills or goals do you want to develop?"
6. **Grade Level**: "What grade are you in?"
7. **Previous Experience**: "Have you been involved in clubs before?"

## üîç Data Transformation Logic

### Interest Extraction
```javascript
// Extracts interests from club data
const extractInterestsFromClub = (club) => {
  const interests = [];
  
  // Add category as an interest
  if (club.category) {
    interests.push(club.category);
  }
  
  // Add activities as interests (first 3)
  if (club.activities && Array.isArray(club.activities)) {
    interests.push(...club.activities.slice(0, 3));
  }
  
  // Add benefits as interests (first 2)
  if (club.benefits && Array.isArray(club.benefits)) {
    interests.push(...club.benefits.slice(0, 2));
  }
  
  return interests.length > 0 ? interests : [club.category || 'General'];
};
```

### Commitment Level Mapping
```javascript
// Maps commitment descriptions to standardized levels
const mapCommitmentLevel = (commitment) => {
  if (!commitment) return 'Medium';
  
  const commitmentStr = commitment.toLowerCase();
  if (commitmentStr.includes('low')) return 'Low';
  if (commitmentStr.includes('high')) return 'High';
  return 'Medium';
};
```

### Club Type Mapping
```javascript
// Maps categories to club types
const typeMap = {
  'Academic': 'Academic',
  'Arts': 'Creative',
  'STEM': 'Competitive',
  'Sports': 'Competitive',
  'Leadership': 'Leadership',
  'Cultural': 'Social',
  'Community Service': 'Social',
  'Religious': 'Social',
  'Support': 'Social',
  'Recreational': 'Social'
};
```

## üíª Usage Examples

### Basic Implementation
```jsx
import { allClubData } from '../data/clubData';
import AIClubChatbot from '../components/AIClubChatbot';

function ClubsPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your existing clubs page content */}
      
      {/* AI Chatbot with real club data */}
      <AIClubChatbot allClubData={allClubData} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### With Existing Club Data Import
```jsx
// In your ClubsWebsite.jsx or similar component
import { allClubData, CategoryColors, getClubsBySchool, getAvailableSchools } from '../data/clubData';
import AIClubChatbot from '../components/AIClubChatbot';

function ClubsWebsite() {
  // Your existing state and logic
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your existing clubs display */}
      
      {/* AI Chatbot */}
      <AIClubChatbot allClubData={allClubData} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
