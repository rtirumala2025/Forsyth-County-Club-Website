# 🤖 AI Club Chatbot with Dynamic Follow-up Recommendations

## Overview
The enhanced AI Club Chatbot now supports intelligent follow-up recommendations that adapt to new user input while preserving conversation context. Users can ask for adjustments to their recommendations, and the AI will provide updated suggestions based on their new criteria.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔄 **Dynamic Follow-up Recommendations**
- **Context Preservation**: Remembers original user answers and previous recommendations
- **Intelligent Adaptation**: Updates recommendations based on new user requests
- **No Repetition**: Avoids suggesting the same clubs unless they still fit new criteria
- **Real-time Updates**: Provides fresh recommendations for each follow-up request

### 🎯 **Follow-up Request Types**
The chatbot can handle various types of follow-up requests:

1. **Time Commitment Adjustments**
   - "What if I want less time commitment?"
   - "Show me clubs with lower commitment"
   - "I need something more flexible"

2. **Club Type Changes**
   - "Show me more competitive clubs"
   - "What about social clubs?"
   - "I prefer academic clubs"

3. **Interest Modifications**
   - "Can you suggest clubs for my friend who likes art?"
   - "What about STEM clubs?"
   - "Show me creative clubs"

4. **General Adjustments**
   - "Show me different clubs"
   - "What about clubs for beginners?"
   - "Can you suggest alternatives?"

### 🧠 **Context Management System**

#### Conversation Context State
```javascript
const conversationContext = {
  originalAnswers: {},           // Initial user answers
  followUpRequests: [],          // History of follow-up requests
  currentRecommendations: [],    // Latest recommendations
  lastRecommendationTime: null   // Timestamp of last update
};
```

#### Context Preservation Logic
- **Original Answers**: Stored when first recommendations are generated
- **Follow-up History**: Tracks all follow-up requests for context
- **Recommendation Tracking**: Maintains current recommendations to avoid repetition
- **Dynamic Updates**: Updates context with each new request

## 🔍 **Follow-up Processing Algorithm**

### 1. Request Analysis
```javascript
// Analyze follow-up request type
const requestLower = followUpRequest.toLowerCase();

if (requestLower.includes('less time') || requestLower.includes('lower commitment')) {
  // Filter for low/medium commitment clubs
} else if (requestLower.includes('competitive') || requestLower.includes('competition')) {
  // Filter for competitive clubs
} else if (requestLower.includes('friend') || requestLower.includes('different')) {
  // Suggest different clubs
}
```

### 2. Context-Aware Filtering
```javascript
// Avoid repeating previous recommendations unless they still fit
const previousClubNames = previousRecommendations.map(r => r.clubName);

clubs.forEach(club => {
  if (!previousClubNames.includes(club.name)) {
    // Only suggest clubs not previously recommended
  }
});
```

### 3. Dynamic Criteria Adjustment
- **Time Commitment**: Adjusts based on user's new time constraints
- **Club Type**: Changes focus based on preferred environment
- **Interests**: Updates for friend recommendations or new interests
- **Experience Level**: Considers beginner-friendly options

## 💻 **Component Usage**

### Basic Implementation
```jsx
import { allClubData } from '../data/clubData';
import AIClubChatbot from '../components/AIClubChatbot';

function ClubsPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your existing clubs page content */}
      
      {/* AI Chatbot with follow-up support */}
      <AIClubChatbot allClubData={allClubData} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🔧 **Backend API Enhancement**

### Enhanced AI Prompt for Follow-ups
